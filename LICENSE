Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

1. Source Code. The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any
non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are
granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

3. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
this License and any non-permissive terms apply to the code; keep
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
